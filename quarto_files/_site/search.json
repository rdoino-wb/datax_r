    "text": "Let’s start with a good practice!\n\nWhen starting a new data analysis in R, it’s important to organize your work by having a folder structure for:\n\n\n\n📁 r_training\n\n📁 scripts/ (your code)\n📂 data/ (the datasets you’re using)\n📁 outputs/ (results like plots, tables, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD;\n    A[r_training] --&gt; B[scripts];\n    A --&gt; C[data];\n    A --&gt; D[outputs];\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIt’s good practice to use lowercase and hyphens (-) instead of spaces when naming folders, files, and objects in R. This keeps everything consistent and easier to manage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode available on GitHub."
